# RELAY-PIPE-GUIDED-ROVER-FOR-MONITORING-LANDSLIDE-AFFECTED-COAL-MINES
This project develops a compact, remotely controlled rover designed for monitoring underground coal mines. Using custom CAD-designed parts, the rover navigates tight tunnels and gathers real-time data to assess mine safety. Communication with the base station is done via a wired RJ45 Ethernet connection to ensure reliable data transfer in challenging underground environments.

The rover is equipped with sensors and a camera system that allow operators to control its movement and view live feedback from the mine. This setup provides a safer way to monitor hazardous conditions and helps plan rescue operations by delivering crucial information without exposing humans to risk.
# ABSTRACT
In the wake of coal mine collapses, where workers often find themselves trapped and
 isolated, the urgency for rapid and effective rescue operations is paramount. This
 project aims to address such critical situations by designing and developing a state
of-the-art rover capable of navigating through a strategically drilled pipe to the far side
 of a collapsed mine. The primary objective is to equip rescue teams with real-time
 data and communication capabilities, significantly enhancing the efficiency and safety
 of underground rescue missions.
 
 The rover is engineered to traverse through a narrow pipe drilled through the soil,
 reaching the trapped zone with precision. It is equipped with high-resolution cameras
 capable of capturing detailed images even in low-light conditions, along with advanced
 environmental sensors that measure critical parameters such as gas levels, temperature,
 and humidity. Central to the rover's functionality is the BeagleY-AI board, which serves as the onboard processing unit.These sensors and cameras are vital for assessing the conditions within
 the collapsed mine and detecting potential hazards that could endanger the lives of both
 the trapped workers and the rescue team.
 
 Central to the roverâ€™s functionality is its onboard processing unit, which integrates
 and analyses captured data in real-time. This processing capability ensures that
 only relevant and high-priority information is managed efficiently while transmitting
 everything directly to the base station via a wired connection with real-time, instan
taneous transmission. Unlike traditional wireless communication, which suffers from
 signal interference and delays in underground environments, this wired communication
 system guarantees uninterrupted and ultra-fast data transfer of video, sensor data, and
 audio.
 
 The base station is equipped with a dedicated Graphical User Interface (GUI)
 that enables rescue teams to view live footage, monitor sensor readings, and control
the rover remotely in real time. The instantaneous transmission allows operators
 to make swift and informed decisions. Moreover, the rover facilitates direct two
way communication with trapped workers, allowing rescue teams to provide real-time
 instructions and reassurance while receiving critical updates from the workers location.
 This feature is crucial in maintaining morale and gathering first-hand information about
 the situation.
 
 By integrating imaging systems, environmental sensors, and a robust, real-time
 wired communication system, this project aims to offer a comprehensive solution
 for underground rescue operations. The developed rover will provide rescuers
 with invaluable insights, enabling them to make swift, informed decisions, thereby
 increasing the likelihood of a successful rescue. This innovative approach not only
 enhances the effectiveness of emergency response efforts in coal mine disasters but
 also sets a new standard for safety in hazardous underground environments.
