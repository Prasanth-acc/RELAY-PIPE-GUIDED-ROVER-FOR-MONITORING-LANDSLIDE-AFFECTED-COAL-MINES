# RELAY-PIPE-GUIDED-ROVER-FOR-MONITORING-LANDSLIDE-AFFECTED-COAL-MINES
This project develops a compact, remotely controlled rover designed for monitoring underground coal mines. Using custom CAD-designed parts, the rover navigates tight tunnels and gathers real-time data to assess mine safety. Communication with the base station is done via a wired RJ45 Ethernet connection to ensure reliable data transfer in challenging underground environments.

The rover is equipped with sensors and a camera system that allow operators to control its movement and view live feedback from the mine. This setup provides a safer way to monitor hazardous conditions and helps plan rescue operations by delivering crucial information without exposing humans to risk.
